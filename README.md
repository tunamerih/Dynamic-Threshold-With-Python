# Dynamic-Threshold-With-Python
 Local threshold example with python.

Thresholding or thresholding usually chooses the foreground as the foreground if the pixel value is greater than the threshold, and the background if it is less than the threshold for images with gray channels, and serves to split the image into parts. If the values such as light and shadow values in the picture differ, dynamic thresholding should be made for different parts of the picture instead of the same global thresholding for each pixel.

When global thresholding (such as otsu) gives poor results local thresholding methods should be used.
